# DialoGPT-Discord-Bot

A lil project I did a bit ago which involved fine-tuning a DialoGPT model based on dialogue from Mae in Night in the Woods

chose to do Mae as she's pretty emotive in game (also the game was good lol)

followed [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/make-your-own-rick-sanchez-bot-with-transformers-and-dialogpt-fine-tuning-f85e6d1f4e30) medium post to train the model

there are some weird artefacts from when I scraped the unity files for the dialogue because idk i didn't feel like writing a regex expression that cleaned up all of the dialogue because I was lazy, probably

(eg. "[wave] ... [/wave]")

it's still alright though, most of it is nonsense but it can still have its spotlight moments
